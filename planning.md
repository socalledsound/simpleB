Next week in math class : 

particle systems and fast fourier transforms.

start with the fourier on monday and draw freqs to particles on weds.


monday fourier first, how do i use this thing, then, what is is exactly?  then, using it some more
assignment: load a sound, perform fft analysis, draw waveform.
image in background?  scrolling?


weds.:
what is a particle system?
ok cool lets take our fft analysis from last time and draw the values to particles!
let's make it plenty abstract!
